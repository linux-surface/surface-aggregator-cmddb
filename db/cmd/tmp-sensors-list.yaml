      Bitset indicating available sensors.

      Available sensors are marked with a set bit at the respective position,
      following the usual bit-indexing from least- to most-significant bit.
      Supports up to 16 sensors at most.

      Note that sensor instance IDs start at one, i.e. BIT(0) returns whether
      the sensor with instance ID 1 is present.
