  - name: valid
    type: u8
    note: |
      Ignored when using the 'set' command. Only relevant for the 'get'
      command. Set this to zero.

  - name: millisecond
    type: u16
    note: |
      Values are ignored. ACPI RTC capabilities (_GCP) indicate that
      milliseconds are not supported. Set this to zero.

  - name: timezone
    type: i16
    desc: |
      Timezone as offset from local time to UTC in minutes. Ranges from -1440
      to +1440, i.e. -24h to +24h. As formula: `t_utc = t_local + timezone`.
    note: |
      While 'get-v1' always returns invalid (= 2047), this seems to set the
      timezone that can be returned with 'get-v2'.

  - name: dst
    type: u8
    desc: Daylight savings time flags. See ACPI RTC specification (ACPI000E).

  - name: pad
    type: (u8; 3)
    desc: Padding. Set this to zero.

response:   # 4 bytes
  - name: status
    type: u32
    desc: |
      Status of command. Zero indicates success, nonzero indicates failure.
