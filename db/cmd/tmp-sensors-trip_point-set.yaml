description: Set trip point temperatures for specified sensor.
interface: tmp/sensors

note: |
  Payload seems to be optional. Maybe no payload clears the trip point.

  Events are sent immediately when the newly set thresholds have already been
  crossed (larger than upper threshold or lower than lower threshold) before
  setting them.

request:
  target-category: 0x03
  target-id:       0x01
  instance-id:     sensor_id
  command-id:      0x09

payload:    # 4 bytes
  - name: upper_threshold
    type: u16
    desc: |
      Upper temperature threshold. A "trip point corssed" notification will be
      sent if the temperature of the specified sensor gets larger than this
      threshold value.

      Temperature values are given in 1/100 degree celsius.

  - name: lower_threshold
    type: u16
    desc: |
      Lower temperature threshold. A "trip point corssed" notification will be
      sent if the temperature of the specified sensor gets smaller than this
      threshold value.

      Temperature values are given in 1/100 degree celsius.

response:   # 1 byte
  - name: status
    type: u8
    desc: |
      Zero on success, nonzero on failure (e.g. thresholds reversed).
