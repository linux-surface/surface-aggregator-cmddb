  Platform/performance profile interface.

  The performance profile controls various performance states via SAM. Specific
  effects vary from device to device and are somewhat unclear. On the Surface
  Book 2, for example, the performance profile controls the fan curve for the
  discrete GPU cooling fan.

  Known performance profile IDs are provided below:
