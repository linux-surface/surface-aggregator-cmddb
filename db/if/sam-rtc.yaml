  Persistent real-time clock (RTC) interface.

  The RTC has multiple (sub-)interfaces, but only stores one set of values,
  i.e. setting the clock via one interface (e.g. UNIX timestamp) impacts all
  other interfaces (e.g. time-and-date v1 and v2).

  The UNIX timestamp is tracked at UTC. Changing the time via the time-and-date
  interface changes the UNIX timestamp under consideration of the specified
  timezone value, keeping it at UTC while adjusting the time and date of the
  time-and-date interface to show values in accordance with the current time
  zone.
