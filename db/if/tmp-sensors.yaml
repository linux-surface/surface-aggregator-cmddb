  Thermal sensor interface.

  This interface supports reading thermal sensors and setting up trip-points
  for thermal notifications. Available sensors should first be queried via the
  tmp/sensors/list command. Individual sensors are addressed with instance IDs.
  Valid sensor instance IDs start with one. A maximum of 16 sensors are
  supported. For general (sensor-independent) functions, an instance-id of zero
  is used.

  Trip points can be configured via tmp/sensors/set_trip_point, which support
  setting of both upper and lower thresholds. Notifications will be sent when
  the temperature either gets higher than the upper or lower than the lower
  threshold.

  All temperature values are given in 1/100 degree celsius, i.e. conversion to
  degree celsius requires dividing by 100. Valid temperature values range from
  0 to i16::max. Negative values are not supported.
