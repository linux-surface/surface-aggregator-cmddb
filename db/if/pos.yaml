  Interface to obtain device posture information and receive notifications
  about device posture changes.

  Usage
  -----

  The posture subsystem seems to support multiple sensor/source IDs. A list of
  available sources can be obtained via `pos/sources/list`. Posture values can
  be queried via `pos/posture/get`, to which a valid source ID must be
  provided. Therefore general usage is first getting/validating the source ID
  and then getting the posture value using that ID.

  Surface Laptop Studio
  ---------------------

  The Surface Laptop Studio seems to support a single posture source with ID 3.
  Observed posture state values for this source are

    | Value | Description                                         |
    |-------|-----------------------------------------------------|
    |     0 | Laptop mode with lid closed.                        |
    |     1 | Laptop mode with lid open (i.e., normal operation). |
    |     2 | Slate or flipped mode.                              |
    |     3 | Tablet mode (flipped display, lid fully closed).    |
