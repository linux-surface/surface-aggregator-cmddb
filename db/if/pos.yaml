  Interface to obtain device posture information and receive notifications
  about device posture changes.

  Usage
  -----

  Posture states consist of a source ID and a posture value. The source ID
  defines the type of sensor / source / component of which the posture can be
  changed. For example, the type-cover uses a different ID than the Surface
  Laptop Studio display as it can assume different postures. The set of
  possible posture values is directly tied to the source ID. 

  Although it has not been observed yet, the posture subsystem seems supports
  multiple source IDs in paralle.
  
  A list of available sources can be obtained via `pos/sources/list`. Posture
  values can be queried via `pos/posture/get`, to which a valid source ID must
  be provided. Therefore, general usage is first getting/validating the source
  ID and then getting the posture value using that ID.

  Known Source IDs
  ----------------

    | Value | Device / Description                                |
    |-------|-----------------------------------------------------|
    |     0 | Type-Cover (as found on the Surface Pro 9)          |
    |     3 | Surface Laptop Studio                               |

  Source 0: Type-Cover
  --------------------

  On newer Surface Pro devices (the Surface Pro 9 and potentially later
  generations), the type-cover provides a posture source with ID 0. The KIP
  interface providing a similar interface on prior generations (e.g., the
  Surface Pro X) is no longer available. Observed posture state values for this
  source are

    | Value | Description                                         |
    |-------|-----------------------------------------------------|
    |     1 | Cover disconnected                                  |
    |     2 | Cover/lid closed                                    |
    |     3 | Laptop mode                                         |
    |     4 | Canvas/slate mode (cover folded back partially)     |
    |     5 | Folded-back (cover folded back fully)               |

  Source 3: Surface Laptop Studio
  -------------------------------

  The Surface Laptop Studio seems to support a single posture source with ID 3.
  Observed posture state values for this source are

    | Value | Description                                         |
    |-------|-----------------------------------------------------|
    |     0 | Laptop mode with lid closed                         |
    |     1 | Laptop mode with lid open (i.e., normal operation)  |
    |     2 | Slate or flipped mode                               |
    |     3 | Tablet mode (flipped display, lid fully closed)     |
